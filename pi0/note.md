## How much data do you need?

For `pi0`, 1e5 events in the first mdst is enough.

## What kind of fit do you need?

To see a `pi0` peak, no fit is needed. A simple `reconstructDecay` will do the job.

## Which list should be used for `Sigma+`?

`pi0` reconstructed from `gamma:pi0eff50` seems good and the background looks flat.
